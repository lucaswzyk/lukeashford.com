    "title": "The Where and Why of My Journey",
    "aboutme": "I've been a performer since I was a child. Initially, I focused on music, particularly singing. In a boarding school with a vocal focus, I received training in classical and musical theater singing, piano, conducting, music history, and theory. My passion for acting began during a student exchange year in Florida, USA. Although I didn't attend a film or theater school, I've continuously taken private lessons and learned through practical experiences in various projects.\n\nBesides my love for art, I've always been passionate about technology, especially software. This interest led me to degrees in computer science and mathematics, which give me the freedom to choose my artistic projects based on genuine passion. Working as a software developer allows me to explore innovative and experimental projects, most recently in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nThree years ago, I moved to Berlin to pursue filmmaking. Since then, I've been involved in several arthouse projects and have realized my own ideas. Now I'm looking for representation by an acting agency to take my career to the next level.",
