  title: "A Bit About Myself",
  aboutme: `From an early age, I have been a performer at heart. Growing up, I focused on music, especially singing. At a boarding school with a strong emphasis on vocal training, I received education in classical and musical theatre singing, piano, conducting, music history, and theory. My passion for acting began during a student exchange year in Florida, USA. Although I haven't attended a formal film or theatre school, I have continuously taken private lessons and learned through hands-on experience in various projects.
    
  In addition to my love for the arts, I have always been passionate about technology, particularly software. This dual interest led me to pursue degrees in computer science and mathematics, which has given me the freedom to choose my artistic projects based on genuine passion. Working as a software developer allows me to explore innovative and experimental projects, most recently involving artificial intelligence.
    
  Three years ago, I moved to Berlin to pursue filmmaking. Since then, I have been involved in several arthouse projects and brought my own ideas to life. Now, I am seeking representation with an actor's agency to elevate my career to the next level.`,
